    <h1> Filip Rutko 
        <p>Hello! Welcome to my online CV. I am currently an <strong> ESSEC Global BBA year 1</strong> student of the English track. The core subjects of my program are Applied Mathematics, Financial Accounting, Microeconomics, Marketing, Excel, and Geopolitics. While being enrolled in this program I wish to continue my journey both academically and with professional experience. I wish to continue to develop soft skills as well as <strong> analytical and mathematical skills</strong>.
            I would love to further develop my career in the fields of <strong> Strategy and Consulting, and Finance</strong>. I love to meet new people from different backgrounds which enables me, not only to learn their language, but to acquire a broader range of knowledge about their culture and create new and precious connections around the world.</p>
